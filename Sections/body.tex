\section{What Is Statistics?}

\subsection{Introduction}

\begin{defn}[\idx{statistics}]
    a theory of information with inference-making as its objective.
\end{defn}

\begin{rmrk}[\idx{The objective of statistics}]
    The objective of statistics is to make an inference about a population based on information contained in a sample from that population and to provide an associated measure of goodness for the inference.
\end{rmrk}

\begin{defn}[\idx{population}]
    the large body of data that is the target of our interest.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}[\idx{sample}]
    a subset selected from a population.
\end{defn}

\subsection{Characterizing a Set of Measurements: Graphical Methods}

\begin{exmp}[\idx{relative frequency histogram}]
    given data set $[2.1,2.4,2.2,2.3,2.7,2.5,2.4,2.6.2.6,2.9]$ we could construct the \textbi{relative frequency histogram}:
